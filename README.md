### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description
A comprehensive career readiness system that compares student skills against role-based requirements, calculates readiness scores, identifies prioritized skill gaps, and generates customized learning paths with curated resources

### The Problem statement
Students struggle to understand the gap between their current skills and industry requirements for placements, leading to unfocused preparation, wasted time on irrelevant topics, and ultimately lower placement success rates. College placement cells lack data-driven insights to identify common skill deficiencies across batches and cannot effectively plan targeted training programs.

### The Solution
SkillSync combines algorithmic skill gap analysis with Google Gemini AI to deliver personalized career readiness insights. The platform analyzes student profiles against industry requirements, calculates readiness scores, and uses Gemini AI to generate intelligent learning recommendations, contextual study guidance, and personalized resource curation. This AI-enhanced approach ensures students receive not just a list of gaps, but actionable, prioritized learning paths with explanations tailored to their unique situation and learning style.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

ChatGPT, Claude AI

**Tool Used:** Git, GitHub, Flask, Gemini API

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Flask was chosen for its lightweight, flexible architecture that allows rapid API development with minimal boilerplate code, making it ideal for building RESTful endpoints for our skill analysis backend.
- Google Gemini AI was integrated to provide intelligent, context-aware learning recommendations and personalized career guidance that adapts to each student's unique skill profile and learning needs.
- GitHub was used for version control, collaborative development, and code management, enabling us to track changes, maintain project history, and facilitate seamless teamwork throughout the development process.

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a GEMINI API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Integrate Flask to develop the backend"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately 65%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
